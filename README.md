# Alexa_for_Hofstra
This is my senior design project. Me and my partner worked on creating this alexa skill. The main portion of this project was in python under lamada_function.py and requires to be run on amazon aws. The other main file that creates the voice inter face on alexa skill services is AlexaSkill.json. These two files run on the different services and provide information back and forth depending on what question was asked. You are welcome to view the code and how it was typed but will not be able to run the code unless on alexa serives and amazon aws.
