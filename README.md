# Alexa_for_Hofstra
This is my senior design project. We are working on building a device off of a raspberry pi that will display and tell 
information about hofstra when asked. We will be creating a app on the alexa that will be able to handle queries related to 
information about hofstra. 

The project is currently in prgress but as files become avaliable it will be displayed here.
